# John Doe's Data Science Project Competition journal

## March 2020 (8h)

* 8. (0.5): Meeting with supervisor.
* 14. (2h): Read about fMRIs and their storage formats NIfTI-1 & 2. Read 
* 14. (2h): Explored the neural_parcellated_gbc.csv dataset. Visualized proportions of classes of the patients. Calcualted proportions of patients and control. 
* 15. (3h): Learned about scikit-learn MLP classifier. Tested the model for binary classication of patient and control. Tested the model in multiclass classification of the diseases (BPP, SCZP, etc.). Performed hyper parameter tunning. Trained the models with best parameters and reported performance.
* 22. (0.5h): Meeting with supervisor.


## April 2020 (21.5h)

* 2. (2h): First attempt at processing data with new 12 region parcellation.
* 3. (5h): Processing data with new parcellation correctly, adapting evaluation notebooks to work with the new data, trying different 
parameters to see if accuracy improved.
* 5. (0.5h): Meeting with supervisor.
* 17. (2h): Literature review: overview of all available documentation on B-SNIP based studies and in the PANSS scale.
* 17. (1h): Processing corrected gbc data with 12 region parcellation
* 17. (2h): Retesting and improving evaluation of models built with the different datasets. Comparing the results.
* 17. (6h): Literature review, summarizing B-SNIP paper of the data, writing interim report. 
* 18. (3h): Finishing up the interim report. Retesting results, adding uncertainty and correcting train set performance calculation.
