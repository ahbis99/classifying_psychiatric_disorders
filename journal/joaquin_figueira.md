## March 2024 (19h)

* 8. (0.5): Meeting with supervisor.
* 14. (6h): Read about fMRIs and their storage formats NIfTI-1 & 2. Read about BSNIP and understanding the problem of PSD classification. 
* 14. (4h): Explored the neural_parcellated_gbc.csv dataset. Visualized proportions of classes of the patients. Calcualted proportions of patients and control. 
* 15. (6h): Learned about scikit-learn MLP classifier. Tested the model for binary classication of patient and control. Tested the model in multiclass classification of the diseases (BPP, SCZP, etc.). Performed hyper parameter tunning. Trained the models with best parameters and reported performance.
