# Ahmet Calis's Data Science Project Competition journal

## March 2020 (9h)

- (1h): Checked the FMRI sources that professor provided.
- (1h): Explored the neural_parcellated_gbc.csv dataset.
- (2h): Watched Python FMRI Analysis tutorials on Youtube.
- (4h): I did feature selection to reduce the amount of features and tried it with XGBoost. Hyper parameter tuning for XGBoost.(Mainly dealed with overfitting).
- (1h): Meeting with professor (in February).

## April 2020 (75h)

- (3h): Prepared Graph representation for each pconn file.
- (4h): Bulding machine learning (XGBoost) with graph based data and fine tuning the parameters.
- (4h): Read related work papers especially for graph based solutions.
- (2h): Meeting with professor (in March).
- (8h): Followed FMRI tutorial from Coursera.
- (12h): Network analysis understanding.
- (6h): Checked tutorials about basics of graph neural networks (Stanford - Jure Leskovec).
- (12h): Checked related works to see which network stats can be beneficial to use in machine learning from papers and blog readings and understading of these statistics.
- (6h): Reading implementations of graph based approaches to FMRI Analysis on Kaggle and Github.
- (8h): Extended last work with new network statistics. Trained a model with new data. Finetuned the parameters.
- (10h): Read course materials and papers about network similarity approaches.

## May 2020 (62h)

- (6h): Implementation of simplified d-measure for graph similarity.
- (12h): Read about different feature selection techniques from blogposts and followed a tutorial from udemy to deepen the basic feature selection we did in the beginning of the competition.
- (8h): Feature selection notebook preperation and training model.
- (12h): Network analysis understanding.
- (6h): Read about Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks.
- (8h): Understading of why that 5 features I found in the feature selection would be important. Checking graph statistics for that 5 features to identify it.
- (2h): Model training with 5 features + networks statistics to see if network statistics can boost the performance.
- (2h): Meeting with the professor. (in May)
- (6h): Adding related parts to the report and the presentation. Correcting the report based on the feedback from supervisor.
  
## Total: [146h]
