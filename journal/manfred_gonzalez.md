# John Doe's Data Science Project Competition journal
## March 2024 (5.5h)

        (0.5h): Read about fMRIs and their storage formats NIfTI-1 & 2. Read
        (2h): Trained a RandomForest, Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting baselines over the binary classification. We obtained an accuracy grater than 95%. Then I also trained the same algorithms with the second level of classification where I got a decrease in accuracy of 40%.
        (1.5h): Debug the dataset and the code. Read the paper: Self- and Semi-Supervised learning for Tabular Domain. This paper could help us to create syntetic data to increase the number of samples in all categories.
        (1.5h): Explored data augmentation and feature selection over the same last baselines

        (2h): Explorationn of the PhD thesis "The Contribution of Temporal Information in the Computation of Brain Functional Connectivity When Assessing Its Association with Interpersonal Differences in Behaviour"
        (4h): Implementation of a notebook to explore .pconn.nii files and create graphs based in the strong correlation between regions
        (8h): Report creation and SOTA review
