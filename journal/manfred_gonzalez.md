# John Doe's Data Science Project Competition journal
## March 2024 (4h)

        (0.5h): Read about fMRIs and their storage formats NIfTI-1 & 2. Read
        (2h): Trained a RandomForest, Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting baselines over the binary classification. We obtained an accuracy grater than 95%. Then I also trained the same algorithms with the second level of classification where I got a decrease in accuracy of 40%.
        (1.5): Debug the dataset and the code. Read the paper: Self- and Semi-Supervised learning for Tabular Domain. This paper could help us to create syntetic data to increase the number of samples in all categories.
        (1.5): Explored data augmentation and feature selection over the same last baselines
